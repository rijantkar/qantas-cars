Qantas Cars

## Download/Run Guide

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rohitszone/qantas-cars.git
cd qantas-cars
npm install
npm start
```

Points to be noted:
* App is designed to be responsive on desktop and compatible in various mobile and tablet devices.
* I have kept the focus towards the output of the assignment as described in pdf.
* Used GraphQL with Apollo/Client defining a role oriented folder structure.
* I have enabled standard ESLint.
* I have limited test cases in place given the focus towards achieving the goal was to develop project with all components working with graphQL in limited time. 
* I observe the size of image is quite high, hence the loading time could be higher.

I hope you like the assigment!

Thank you.
